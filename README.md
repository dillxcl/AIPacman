First part of the project:
  1. Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py.
  2. Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in the breadthFirstSearch function in search.py.
  3. Implement A* graph search in the empty function aStarSearch in search.py.
 

Second part of the project:
  1. Implement the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. You will need to choose a state representation that            encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached.
   
  2. Implement a heuristic for the CornersProblem in cornersHeuristic.
      - Expanding any nodes - admissible heuristic; however, bad algorithm
      - Expanding less than 1600 nodes - acceptable algorithm
      - Expanding less than 1200 nodes - great alogrithm
      - Expanding less than 800 nodes - excellent alogrithm
